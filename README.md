# TunaDB
^name for database to be decided :)

This project is a simplified version of a Cassandra-like distributed database written in Go. It is designed as a part of a Computer Science course called **Distributed Systems and Computing**. The project simulates core distributed database concepts such as consistent hashing, gossip protocol, quorum-based consensus, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.20 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- `protoc` compiler for gRPC

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uimagine-admin/tunadb.git
   cd tunadb
   ```


2.	**Generate gRPC code**:
Generate the grpc code using protoc:
Here you might want to install and set the env path variables!

    ```bash
    protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/cassandra.proto
    ```
3.	**Build and Run the Docker containers**:
Navigate to the docker directory and run the following command to start up the Cassandra nodes:

    ```
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
    ```

### It should look like this!

### Folder Structure Overview

```
•	docker/: Contains Docker and Docker Compose configurations to set up a multi-node Cassandra cluster.
•	proto/: Holds the protobuf file (cassandra.proto) for defining the gRPC service used for communication between nodes.
•	cmd/: Contains entry points for running the server and client applications.
•	internal/: Core logic for the distributed database:
•	consistenthash/: Contains code for consistent hashing and the ring algorithm.
•	db/: Implements database storage, including in-memory tables (memtable) and persistent storage (SSTable).
•	replication/: Manages replica placement, quorum reads/writes, and eventual consistency.
•	gossip/: Manages the gossip protocol for node communication and status updates.
•	failure/: Implements failure detection mechanisms and node recovery.
•	utils/: Provides helper functions like logging and configuration management.
•	api/: Contains generated gRPC code to facilitate communication between client and server.
•	scripts/: Bash scripts to automate running the cluster and testing the system.
